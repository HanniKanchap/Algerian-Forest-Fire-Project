Algerian Forest Fire Prediction using Ridge Regression
This project applies Ridge Regression to predict forest fire occurrence in Bejaia and Sidi Bel-abbes, Algeria using meteorological data. By mitigating multicollinearity, Ridge Regression enhances model stability and generalization.
📂 Dataset Overview
- Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nitinchoudhary012/algerian-forest-fires-dataset
- Instances: 244 (138 fire cases, 106 no-fire cases).
- Features:
- Temperature (°C)
- Relative Humidity (%)
- Wind Speed (km/h)
- Rainfall (mm)
